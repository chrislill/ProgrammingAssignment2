## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache it's inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}




## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
